# 📂 Java Backend Project Ideas After DSA

After mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java, the next step is to apply those concepts in backend-focused projects. These projects emphasize core logic, algorithms, file handling, and database integration — no GUI or frontend required.

## 🔧 1. Library Management System (Console-Based)
**DSA Concepts:** Arrays, LinkedLists, HashMaps  
**Features:**
- Add, remove, and search books
- Track issued/returned books
- Admin vs user operations
- Optional: File/database persistence

---

## 🧠 2. Quiz/Test Engine
**DSA Concepts:** Lists, Maps, Timers  
**Features:**
- Console-based MCQ quiz
- Random question selection
- Score tracking and ranking
- Timed responses

---

## 💬 3. Multi-User Chat Server (CLI-based, Using Sockets)
**DSA Concepts:** Queues, Threads, HashMaps  
**Features:**
- Socket-based client-server messaging
- Multiple user handling via threads
- Message broadcasting or private chat

---

## 📊 4. Expense Tracker (File or DB Storage)
**DSA Concepts:** Lists, Maps  
**Features:**
- Record daily expenses
- Monthly reports from console
- Data storage in files or MySQL

---

## 🕵️ 5. File Search and Management Tool
**DSA Concepts:** Recursion, Trees  
**Features:**
- Search files in nested directories
- Filter by name, size, or type
- Copy/move/delete files from console

---

## 🧮 6. DSA Algorithms as Services (CLI Tool)
**DSA Concepts:** Sorting, Searching, Graphs  
**Features:**
- CLI-based tool to run:
  - Sorting algorithms on arrays
  - Pathfinding in graphs
  - Tree traversals
- Compare time/space complexity

---

## 👥 7. Basic Social Network Backend (Console)
**DSA Concepts:** Graphs, BFS/DFS  
**Features:**
- Store users and connections
- Find mutual friends
- Suggest friends (based on graph distance)

---

## 🧰 8. Custom Data Structures Library
**DSA Concepts:** All core data structures  
**Features:**
- Implement Stack, Queue, LinkedList, Graph, Tree from scratch
- Provide unit-tested APIs
- Make it reusable for future projects

---

## 🗃️ 9. Task Management CLI App
**DSA Concepts:** Queues, Lists  
**Features:**
- Add/edit/remove daily tasks
- Prioritize tasks (using PriorityQueue)
- Persist to file or DB

---

## 📑 10. Resume Parser and Sorter
**DSA Concepts:** Strings, Trees, Maps  
**Features:**
- Read resumes (.txt or .json)
- Parse keywords and skills
- Sort by experience or skill match

---

### ✅ Tips
- Keep each module clean and modular.
- Use version control wisely (one commit per logical update).
- Write README and test cases for each project.
- Focus on core algorithm efficiency, clean structure, and reusability.
